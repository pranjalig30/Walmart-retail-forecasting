# Walmart-retail-forecasting

Walmart, the American giant leading in the retail industry, like all retail companies, is interested to gather insights on its historical data to forecast future unit sales of respective products to better mitigate opportunity losses and manage its inventory. 
In this project, our team worked with hierarchical sales data from Walmart, covering stores across California, Texas, and Wisconsin to train our prediction models and record the performance metrics. 
The extensive datasets include details at item, department, product category, and store levels, along with additional explanatory variables like price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. 
Leveraging the rich datasets by thoroughly examining the columns and diligently engineering the features is crucial for improving forecasting accuracy.

The solution involves exploring various machine learning models to forecast unit sales. 
It encompasses ensemble methods such as LightGBM, and CatBoost, alongside neural network architectures like LSTM, and linear regression models like Ridge. 
The choice of models aims to capture complex patterns in the sales data and enhance predictive accuracy. Our solution aim to use the most relevant features to accurately predict the sales amount for each product,
which brings proactive competitive advantage to Walmart in the realm of supply chain and operations like inventory management.
